# Advent Of Code 2020
My set of Python solutions for the [Advent Of Code 2020](http://adventofcode.com/2020/) problems

## How do I use this?
For day _N_, just run:
`$ python main.py N`

For day _N_ part 2:
`$ python main.py N 2`

If you are still having problems to understand, this will retrieve the answer for day 8 part 2:
`$ python main.py 8 2`

## Okay, fine. I got it. How do I change the input to fit the one generated for me?
All these scripts expect a text file `input.txt` in the same module. You can just replace the content of these files...
